	Short: "Run as HTTP Server",
	Long: `
Run as an HTTP Server and launch probes when invoked. 

When running in serve mode, probicon will listen for requests to /probe and, when invoked
with a GET, will execute a probe and return with the status of the specified endpoint address.

The GET request to /probe should include an address at a bare minimum as part of the query string. Valid
query string parameters are:
	address      - Endpoint to probe. Required.
	timeout      - Timeout in seconds for the address response. Defaults to 10 seconds.
	expectscode  - Expected HTTP status code (e.g. 200). Ignored if not specified.
	expectsvalue - Expected case-sensitive string value to be found within the response body. Ignored if not specified.

The /probe handler returns a simple JSON document in the following format:
{
	"IsDown":<true / false>,
	"ErrorMessage":<message string>,
	"ResponseTime":<response time in milliseconds>,
	"ResponseCode":<http status code>
}

Return Example:
{"IsDown":false,"ErrorMessage":"","ResponseTime":411,"ResponseCode":"200 OK"}

This example shows that the endpoint was up, had no error messages, responded in 411
milliseconds and returned a 200 OK HTTP status code.

Handler Examples:

Run a simple probe to see if the endpoint responds:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/probe?address=https://google.com

Run a simple probe to see if the endpoing response within 20 seconds:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/probe?address=https://google.com&timeout=20

Run a probe and ensure HTTP 200 is returned within 20 seconds
http://127.0.0.1:8080/probe?address=https://google.com&timeout=20&expectscode=200

Run a probe and ensure Username is found within the webpage body content:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/probe?address=https://google.com&timeout=20&expectscode=200&expectsvalue=Username
